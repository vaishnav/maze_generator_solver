Generating non-perfect mazes and solving them with different algorithms (GUI)
___


## About Project
Maze is generated using recursive backtracking([Maze generating algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)) and than randomly erasing walls between blocks to generate non-perfect maze

I've implemented depth and bredth first serach algorithms for now but will also include dijkstra and a* in future
